    <h4>Build New Bases</h4>
    <p>
        At the cost of 2 resource tokens each, each team may designate
        locations where they have presence as new bases. <strong>Note:</strong>
        when building a base, the chosen defense objective is set to "Base Defense: Armed Station".
        You can change the objective via the Locations tab after the base is built.
